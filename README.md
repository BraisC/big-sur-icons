<p align="center">A collection of re-imagined icons for popular apps in the macOS Big Sir style</p>
<hr />

## Motivation

Love it, hate it, or meh, the styling of macOS Bir Sur is here. I happen to like the new icons, but some of the pre-Big Sur icons look out of place. I set out to change that.

## Instuctions

[wip]

## Contribute

To add an icon to the list, create a folder under `icons`. Place the png file and the psd file in the folder. Optionally, create a `README` file with any needed explaination. Then create a pull request.

> Please use the naming convention of all lower case with dashes `-` between words.

For your convenience, there is a Photoshop template in `/docs/big-sur-icon-template.psd`.

For example, to add an icon for the popular Foo app:

```
/icons
  /brave
    brave.png
    brave.psd
  /foo
    foo.png
    foo.psd
    README.md
```
